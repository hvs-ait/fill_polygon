# Fill Polygon
Fill the inner area bounded by a polygon, including a self-intersecting one.

This algorithm solves the problem of filling the inner area bounded by a self-intersecting polygon, a scenario where the OpenCV's function [fillPoly()](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d6e/group__imgproc__draw.html#ga311160e71d37e3b795324d097cb3a7dc) fails. This implementation can fill a polygon that overlaps itself multiple times.
